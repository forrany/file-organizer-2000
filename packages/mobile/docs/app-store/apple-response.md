# Response to App Store Review Team

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding our app, Note Companion AI. We have addressed the issues mentioned in your review:

## Regarding Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed

We are not using in-app purchases in our application. According to the updated App Store Guidelines for the US storefront, apps are allowed to include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase (as referenced in guidelines 3.1.1(a) and 3.1.3(a)).

Our app uses this permitted external link approach for subscription management, directing users to our website (notecompanion.ai) to complete purchases.

You can locate the subscription information in our app by:
1. Opening the app and signing in
2. Going to the Settings tab
3. Scrolling to the "Account Status" section
4. Viewing the "Upgrade on notecompanion.ai" button and associated information

## Regarding Guideline 3.1.2 - Subscriptions

We have updated our app to include all required subscription information:

1. **Title of publication/service**: "Note Companion AI - Cloud Plan" is now clearly displayed
2. **Length of subscription**: "Monthly (recurring payment, cancel anytime)" is now specified
3. **Price of subscription**: "$15.00/month" is now clearly indicated
4. **Terms of Use (EULA)**: A functional link to our Terms of Service is now included in both the subscription information section and the Legal section of our app

We believe these changes fully address the requirements outlined in your review. The app now provides users with clear and complete information about our external subscription offering as permitted by the updated App Store Guidelines for the US storefront.

Please let us know if you need any additional information to complete the review.

Thank you,
The Note Companion AI Team
