### If you are having issues with "License Key Invalid" 

- Use the URL that you see after clicking on the page you deployed (as shown below)
If you see a bunch of random numbers + letters in your URL, you are using the wrong one.
If it includes "self-hosted" or "dashboard", you are also using the wrong url
